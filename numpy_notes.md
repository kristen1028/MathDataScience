# Python NumPy and Matplotlib Basics

This README file provides an overview of several fundamental functions and concepts in Python using the NumPy and Matplotlib libraries.

## NumPy Basics

### `np.zeros(shape)`

The `np.zeros(shape)` function creates a NumPy array filled with zeros. It takes a `shape` parameter, which specifies the dimensions (rows and columns) of the array. For example:

```python
import numpy as np

zeros_array = np.zeros((3, 4))  # Creates a 3x4 array filled with zeros
```

### `np.ones(shape)`

Similar to `np.zeros()`, `np.ones(shape)` creates a NumPy array filled with ones. It also takes a `shape` parameter to specify the dimensions of the array:

```python
import numpy as np

ones_array = np.ones((2, 3))  # Creates a 2x3 array filled with ones
```

### `np.eye(N)`

The `np.eye(N)` function generates an identity matrix of size `N x N`. An identity matrix is a square matrix with diagonal elements equal to 1 and all other elements equal to 0:

```python
import numpy as np

identity_matrix = np.eye(4)  # Creates a 4x4 identity matrix
```

### `np.linspace(start, stop, num)`

`np.linspace(start, stop, num)` creates an array of `num` evenly spaced values between `start` and `stop`, inclusive. This is often used to create evenly spaced values for plotting or numerical computations:

```python
import numpy as np

evenly_spaced_values = np.linspace(0, 1, 5)  # Creates an array with 5 evenly spaced values between 0 and 1
```

## Matplotlib Basics

### `plt.imshow(array)`

The `plt.imshow(array)` function from the Matplotlib library is used to display images or 2D arrays as visual representations. It takes a NumPy array as input and displays it as an image:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.imshow(image_array)
plt.show()
```

### `plt.plot(x, y)`

`plt.plot(x, y)` is used to create line plots in Matplotlib. It takes two arrays `x` and `y`, representing the x-axis and y-axis values, respectively, to create a line chart:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)  # Generating x values
y = np.sin(x)  # Generating y values (sin function)
plt.plot(x, y)  # Plotting the sine wave
plt.show()
```
